# Receive Email
Let your Laravel app receive emails.

## Installation
```bash
composer require notifiablehq/receive-email
```

## Usage

### 1. Publish Config and Migrations

Publish the configuration and migration files:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Notifiable\\ReceiveEmail\\ReceiveEmailServiceProvider" --tag=receive-email
```
Then run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Listen for Incoming Emails

Whenever an email is received, the package will dispatch the `Notifiable\\ReceiveEmail\\Events\\EmailReceived` event. On Laravel 11 and above, you should use a listener class:

#### Create the Listener

Generate a listener class:

```bash
php artisan make:listener HandleIncomingEmail
```

Then implement the `handle` method:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Notifiable\ReceiveEmail\Events\EmailReceived;

class HandleIncomingEmail
{
    public function handle(EmailReceived $event): void
    {
        $email = $event->email;
        
        \Log::info('Received email with subject: ' . $email->parsedMail()->subject());
    }
}
```

### 3. Accessing Email Data

The `Email` model gives you access to sender, recipients, subject, and body through the `parsedMail` method. Example:

```php
/** @var \Notifiable\ReceiveEmail\Contracts\ParsedMailContract $mail */
$mail = $email->parsedMail();

$subject = $mail->subject();
$textBody = $mail->text();
$htmlBody = $mail->html();
$recipients = $mail->recipients();
```

## Forge Deployment
1. Add this to your recipes, you can name it `Install Mailparse`. Make sure the user is `root`.
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y php-cli php-mailparse
```

2. If you already have an existing server, run this recipe on that server. 
Otherwise, create a new server and make sure to select this recipe as a `Post-Provision Recipe`. 
You'll have to show `Advance Settings` to select this.

3. Once you have the server ready, open up `Port 25`, add your site, and deploy your Laravel app.

4. SSH into your Forge server and go to your site directory. Then run the setup command as a `super user`:
```bash
sudo php artisan notifiable:setup-postfix domain-that-receives-email.com
```

5. Add the following DNS records to your domain:

    | Type | Host                        | Value                 |
    |------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
    | A    | your-application-domain.com | your.forge.ip.address |
 
    | Type | Host                           | Value                | Priority |
    |------|--------------------------------|----------------------| --- |
    | MX   | domain-that-receives-email.com | your-application-domain.com | 10 |
